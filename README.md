# Android_SQLite_NotificationListenerService_NotificationCatcher

The app is an example of using the NotificationListenerService and was made for practice purposes and will be used in a future tutorial.
It is an example of using the SQLite Database,Parametric Queries, Autosuggestion EditText, Intents, BroadcastReceivers, Dialog Boxes and guiding user to
Notifications Access settings menu.

## Functionality/Requirements for the App
The applications should provide the user with the amazing opportunity of catching text from incoming notifications. The applications can catch all incoming notifications or only notifications from a chosen applications. How is this usefull? Maybe for analysing users phones and apps notifications? If connected to the backend and used by many users it could be used to mine statistics regarding notifications. (I would not advise to use my code though).
